	title = {Towards bright and pure single photon emitters at 300 {K} based on {GaN} quantum dots on silicon},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09805},
	abstract = {Quantum dots (QDs) based on III-nitride semiconductors are promising for single photon emission at non-cryogenic temperatures due to their large exciton binding energies. Here, we demonstrate GaN QD single photon emitters operating at 300 K with \$g{\textasciicircum}\{(2)\}(0) = 0.17 {\textbackslash}pm 0.08\$ under continuous wave excitation. At this temperature, single photon emission rates up to \$6{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}6 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}text\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ are reached while \$g{\textasciicircum}\{(2)\}(0) {\textbackslash}leq 0.5\$ is maintained. Our results are achieved for GaN QDs embedded in a planar AlN layer grown on silicon, representing a promising pathway for future interlinkage with optical waveguides and cavities. These samples allow exploring the limiting factors to key performance metrics for single photon sources, such as brightness and single photon purity. While high brightness is assured by large exciton binding energies, the single photon purity is mainly affected by the spectral overlap with the biexcitonic emission. Thus, the performance of a GaN QD as a single photon emitter depends on the balance between the emission linewidth and the biexciton binding energy. We identify small GaN QDs with an emission energy in excess of 4.2 eV as promising candidates for future room temperature applications, since the biexciton binding energy becomes comparable to the average emission linewidth of around 55 meV.},
